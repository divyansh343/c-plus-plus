//1. single inheritance  one base class and one derived class is single inheritace
// class employee ---> class assistanace
//   base class         derived class
// class assistance -- it inherits property of employee, -- it's base class in employee

//2. multiple inheritance
// when one derived class has two or mor base classes.
// class employee  -------->
// class sportspalyer  -------->       class human
// class activis   -------->
// class human is derived from three base classes
// many fathers

// 3. hierarchical inheritance
// a base class has several derived classes
//                          --->      class employee  
//     class human ------------>      class sportspalyer      
//                          --->      class activis   
// many childrens

// 4. multilevel inheritanc
// class animal ----> class mammmals ---> class ---> bat
// a class derived from a class which is also derived from the other class

// 5. hybrid inheritance
// multiple inheritance + multilevel inheritance
